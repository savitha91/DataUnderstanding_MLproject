# Data understanding in ML project

In this project we will apply statistical methods to understand HR_Analytics dataset and come up with feature 
combination list which can used while building models
>One of the important steps in ML project is understanding the data(features).
#### Possible types of features are
1. Continuous
2. Categorical - Ordinal/Nominal

#### Following analysis can be done to understand data better:
##### Know the data distribution=> Univariate analysis
  1. Continuous variable : Central tendency measure
  2.  Categorical variable : Frequency table
##### Know the dependency between features => Bivariate analysis 
  1. Dependency between 2 Continuous variables : PearsonR correlation
  2. Dependency between 2 Categorical variables: Chi-square hypothesis
  3. Dependency between Continuous and Categorical variables : ANOVA hypothesis
  
This module can be tested on any dataset after applying required preprocessing (Eg: Convert DateTime variables)
